-- TEST_MAILROOM --
-------------------
rick used pytset. nose ok, unittest ok

fixture (decorator way) --- see rick's test_mailroom decorator @ line 16 ----- fixture vs setup
>--setup_module is other option
>--but decorator fixture is stronger/better

--> factor out mailroom into functions --> test suite will reflect mailroom's complexity/messiness
--> pickle routine test --> test whether timestamp is updated/file saved

--> doctests are not as powerful (typically only uses ==/!= asserts --> limited)

--> see rick's test_add_donation routine

--> django - management command

--> main why loop --> don't test as-is

--> dictionary as switch --> see p100 notes site --> use for while loop

--> continuous integration -- jenkins module

--> test pyramid (unit tests, integration tests, functional tests) --> maybe not best way to do it --> should depend on your program/prior test stats
